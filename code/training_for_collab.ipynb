RandomResizedCrop(), etc.) will change from None to True in v0.17, in order to be consistent across the PIL and Tensor backends. To suppress this warning, directly pass antialias=True (recommended, future default), antialias=None (current default, which means False for Tensors and True for PIL), or antialias=False (only works on Tensors - PIL will still use antialiasing). This also applies if you are using the inference transforms from the models weights: update the call to weights.transforms(antialias=True).\n","  warnings.warn(\n","INFO:root:epoch: [0][   0/5741], lr: 0.000100, loss: 0.59886.\n","2023-06-09 08:42:15,573 - <ipython-input-7-374883abfb46> [line: 103] - epoch: [0][   0/5741], lr: 0.000100, loss: 0.59886.\n","INFO:root:epoch: [0][ 100/5741], lr: 0.000100, loss: 0.17993.\n","2023-06-09 08:48:28,513 - <ipython-input-7-374883abfb46> [line: 103] - epoch: [0][ 100/5741], lr: 0.000100, loss: 0.17993.\n","INFO:root:epoch: [0][ 200/5741], lr: 0.000100, loss: 0.11936.\n","2023-06-09 08:54:55,486 - <ipython-input-7-374883abfb46> [line: 103] - epoch: [0][ 200/5741], lr: 0.000100, loss: 0.11936.\n","INFO:root:epoch: [0][ 300/5741], lr: 0.000100, loss: 0.14693.\n","2023-06-09 09:01:23,002 - <ipython-input-7-374883abfb46> [line: 103] - epoch: [0][ 300/5741], lr: 0.000100, loss: 0.14693.\n","INFO:root:epoch: [0][ 400/5741], lr: 0.000100, loss: 0.14920.\n","2023-06-09 09:07:50,244 - <ipython-input-7-374883abfb46> [line: 103] - epoch: [0][ 400/5741], lr: 0.000100, loss: 0.14920.\n","INFO:root:epoch: [0][ 500/5741], lr: 0.000100, loss: 0.18635.\n","2023-06-09 09:14:17,471 - <ipython-input-7-374883abfb46> [line: 103] - epoch: [0][ 500/5741], lr: 0.000100, loss: 0.18635.\n"]}]}]}
